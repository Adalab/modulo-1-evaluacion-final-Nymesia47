# Modulo-1-Evaluacion Final -Gabriella Calvano (Nymesia47)

Final project of the Adalab bootcamp first module.
The assignment consisted in creating a web page based on a design provided and make it responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop devises.

# Basic requirements

1. Use of Sass
2. Use of Flexbox and CSS Grid
3. Use of media queries
4. As an extra: have some interaction using transitions

# Project execution

I have divided the main page in 3 sections plus the header and footer.
The header sticks to the top left corner on scrolling.
I used Flexbox for the Hero section and the shop section.
I used Grid for the products highlights section and the Footer.
The icons on the hero section and the footer redirect respectively to the product highlights section and the top of the page.
